# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict survival rates for Titanic passengers.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- RandomForestClassifier with hyperparameter tuning
- Visualizations of survival rates based on various factors

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run data preprocessing: `python src/data/data_preprocessing.py`
4. Train the model: `python src/models/train_model.py`
5. Generate visualizations: `python src/visualization/visualize.py`
